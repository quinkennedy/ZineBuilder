# ZineBuilder

This is a Processing sketch that builds a zine from a series of XML files.

Upon launching the app, you can select a directory to load the zine from.
At the least this directory should contain a `zine.xml` file.
It will also look for `settings.xml` and `style.xml`.

Using the UI, you can set the various settings for the zine.
Don't forget to go to the _Details_ tab.
When you generate your zine, the current settings will be saved over `settings.xml`.

`style.xml` can be used to set various font sizes used for different parts of the zine.
