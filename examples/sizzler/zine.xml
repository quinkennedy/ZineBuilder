		<heading>Welcome to our zine shindig!

We will just jam together to create a group zine. You can participate by creating "WorkshopBox" and "WorkshopText" elements. This zine illustrates a few examples of how to make and use these elements.

A "WorkshopBox" allows you to render graphics into a section (or entire) page.

A "WorkshopText" allows you to generate text which will be rendered by the build-in text rendering engine. Your text can also be consumed by other text generators. Stand on the shoulder of giants!</heading>

	   <heading>Thank you for taking the time to read this zine. Our goals were to discuss:

* Why should we invent computing to extend and augment humans? How will it teach us more deeply about ourselves?

* How can we extend our technologies to the objects and environments which help define who we are and how we live? What new sensing will need to be created?

* What if we understood an acre of land? What if the biomass of the earth were networked? 

We would like to thank the Processing community for making this possible, in particular contributors to Processing Core, CAN_GenerativeTypography, StippleGen2, and iText.

Thanks for reading. Reach us at @sensorycc #sensoryaesthetics</heading>

 	<heading>Information Acre</heading>
	   <subheading>   </subheading>
	   <body>Imagine the bit as the toss of a fair coin. The result is either heads or tails. The "holographic principle" would suggest that there is a limit to the number of bits which physics can support. This amount is placed at 10^69 bits per square meter before the point in which adding more information would collapse into a black hole. This is approximately 1, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 bits per square meter of two dimensional space.

Our proposal: Dedicate 1 square acre of land to the deep pursuit of sensing. Bring scientists, artists, hardware and software designers together to try to make a dent in that information space. Sense the biology, the chemistry, the conditions, and the human reaction to that one acre. Publish this material for the world. 

We have tentatively named this project Information Acre and are currently looking for a suitable area in the Pacific Northwest for this to occur.
